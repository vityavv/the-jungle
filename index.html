	<h3>Inspiration for the project</h3>
	<p>In 1906, Upton Sinclair released a book called <i>The Jungle</i> that showed the awful quality of life for immigrants and unskilled workers through a narative centered around a Lithuanian family. This game uses actual occurences from the book to simulate living in that time, as an imigrant family.</p>
	<h3>How to play</h3>
	<p>First, you must make a family - Enter the names of as many family members as you like. You can choose where you want to live, and then each family member can try to get a job by taking their chances and choosing one card to overturn. After that, you are launched into the main game - you must click on one of the six different cards to see what happens to you. Every two choices you must pay for groceries for each family member, and you have a chance to choose a different dwelling.<br><br>This goes on until you run out of money, or everyone in your family is dead.</p>
